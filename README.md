# Telecomunication company customer churn prediction
We implemented two types of models: Sequential and Functional, and evaluated their performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also compared the base models with improved models by incorporating activation functions, batch normalization, and additional hidden layers.
Based on the evaluation, we found that the improved models (both Sequential and Functional) performed better than the base models with higher accuracy of 92% for predicting churned customers. These models provide a valuable tool for the company to identify customers who are at a higher risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.
Additionally, continuous monitoring and retraining of the model with new data can help maintain its effectiveness over time.
Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and provides insights for the company to take targeted actions to reduce churn and enhance customer retention.
